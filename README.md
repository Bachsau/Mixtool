# Mixtool
An editor for Westwood Studios' MIX files, the data files used in their classic Command & Conquer games from Tiberian Dawn to Red Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge.

Many thanks to Olaf van der Spek for his documentation of the MIX file format and the XCC Utilities (http://xhp.xwis.net/).

**WARNING:** This is alpha software. Most functions won't work as expected and it may destroy the files you open with it! Use at your own risk and always have a backup at hand.
