Contributing to Mixtool
=======================

All aspects of Mixtoolâ€™s development are managed on [GitHub][0].

As long as Mixtool remains in alpha development state, there will be no
public issue tracker and any pull requests will be rejected.

Issue tracking will be enabled when Mixtool reaches beta and a
contributor agreement is ready. Until then, you may contact me by
filling out the [contact form][1] on my website.

**By sending in patches, you assign ownership and copyright of the work
to me!**
